üì¶ API Reference
-----------------

This project does not have a RESTful API, as it is a static website. However, if you'd like to integrate the timer with another application or service, you can use the timer's JavaScript API to fetch and set the timer's state.

### JavaScript API

* `startTimer()` : Starts the timer and begins counting down from the set duration.
* `pauseTimer()` : Pauses the timer and stops the countdown.
* `resumeTimer()` : Resumes the timer and continues counting down from where it was paused.
* `resetTimer()` : Resets the timer to its initial state and clears the countdown.
